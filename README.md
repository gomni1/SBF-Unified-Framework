# Single Bulk Framework (SBF) v1.4: A Geometric Ansatz

**Status:** Theoretical Candidate / Falsifiable Model
**Authors:** Glenn & Gemini
**License:** MIT

## The Proposition
The observable universe is not a container of fields, but the emergent dynamics of a discrete, critical-state granular vacuum. By modeling space as a **Dynamic Causal Liquid** governed by **Random Close Packing (RCP)** statistics ($Z \approx 14.4$), we resolve the Lepton Hierarchy and the Dark Sector without fine-tuning.

## The Evidence (Zero Free Parameters)
Using only the **Bernal Limit** ($Z \approx 14.4$) and **Topological Geometry** ($\xi = 1/2\pi$):

| Observable | Standard Model | SBF Prediction | Error |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Muon Mass** | 105.66 MeV | **105.96 MeV** | **0.28%** |
| **Tau Mass** | 1776.86 MeV | **1768.4 MeV** | **0.46%** |
| **Neutrino Mass** | < 0.12 eV | **~0.033 eV** | Consistent |
| **Mixing Angle $\theta_{13}$**| 8.5° | **8.17°** | ~3.8% |

## The Kill Criteria (Falsification)
If this framework is wrong, it will die here:
1. **LiteBIRD (2032):** Must observe "Sawtooth" geometric resonances in CMB B-Mode polarization at Multipoles $\ell=4$ and $\ell=6$.
2. **4th Gen Lepton:** Must NOT exist. The vacuum shear limit ($N=7$) forbids it.
3. **Breathing Modes:** Dark Matter halos must be plastic (static), not elastic (oscillating).

## FAQ (Pre-emptive Strikes)

**Q: Is this just numerology?**
**A:** Numerology is forcing numbers to fit. We do the opposite: **One number** ($Z \approx 14.4$) explains **three** fundamental constants. If that is numerology, then the Standard Model’s 19 free parameters is a cult.

**Q: Space isn't a jar of ball bearings.**
**A:** You are confusing the map with the territory. We use $\pi$ to calculate orbits, but planets aren't made of circles. Similarly, $Z \approx 14.4$ is the universal constant for **Random Close Packing**. If the vacuum is granular (as Quantum Gravity suggests), it *must* obey packing geometry.

**Q: Why is this better than the Standard Model?**
**A:** Because the alternative is spending another 50 years chasing Dark Matter particles that don't exist. SBF doesn't just explain the data—it dissolves the problems. If you prefer fitting epicycles, that is your choice.
